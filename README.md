Big problem! Luffy fans are trying to steal your luffy. It's up to you to see how long
you can defend your precious luffy.

## This Project has been built at Hack BrewerðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰âœŒ
### [Devfolio Project link](https://devfolio.co/projects/dont-touch-my-luffy-af84)


## Problem Statement:

The Project has been made solely using Pygame library from Python Language.

This game includes some of the awesome features like animation, game movement ,music and 3D transistions.

It was very difficult to build it from scratch since Pygame documentation was very hard to understand. I took help of youtube and StackOverFlow to resolve some issues.

Problem has been approached with a thing in mind that ,this game must be User-Friendly and well optimized while playing in their Android Mobile.

This project has been made from an idea similar to the game Flappy Bird.
The goal is toÂ get past the obstacles without getting distracted by surrounding objects which always change. If your gift touches an obstacle you lose. In this game, the objective is to pass through all the obstacles and not hit the obstacles.

* This Endless game even includes official themes from Anime-One Piece for better user experience.

* This Project Concludes with a game for Android devices and has been made using Pygame.


This [game was made in a day for hackathon] With Python and Pygame.
